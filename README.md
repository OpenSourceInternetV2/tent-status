# TentStatus

TentStatus is a Sinatra/Backbone app that sends/receives Tent status posts.

## Contributing

The app currently isn't very useful because it needs OAuth authentication so
that it can talk to Tent servers.

Here are some tasks that need to be done:

- Implement a omniauth strategy that handles Tent OAuth.
- Write tests/refactor code.
- Make it pretty.
